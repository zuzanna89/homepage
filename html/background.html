        API phase, at which point it is entirely the DevOps function’s
        responsibility. To the DevOps function, the model is just a Python
        function that needs to be turned into a microservice, containerized, and
        deployed. Once the model-microservice is live, product engineers query
        it like any other API. To them, the model is just another web service.
        The Model-API-Client architecture is not the only way to separate the
        concerns of data science and engineering, but it serves to illustrate
        that you can draw a line between data science and DevOps without
        introducing extravagant overhead or building expensive end-to-end
        platforms. By just establishing clear handoff points between functions
        in your ML pipeline, you can free data scientists up to do what they’re
        best at — data science.
